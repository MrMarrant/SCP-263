# SCP-263

SCP-263 is a old black and white television.
SCP-263 has been observed to function even when not connected to a power outlet.

When switched on, the TV always displays the interior of a studio, whose design bears similarities to studios of television game shows from the 1960's.
A large logo, saying "CASH OR ASH" in large, stylized letters can be seen on the generic of the show.
