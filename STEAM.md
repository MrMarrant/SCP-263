[h2]Features[/h2]
SCP-263 is a old black and white television.
SCP-263 has been observed to function even when not connected to a power outlet.

When switched on, the TV always displays the interior of a studio, whose design bears similarities to studios of television game shows from the 1960's.
A large logo, saying "CASH OR ASH" in large, stylized letters can be seen on the generic of the show.

The aim of this addon was to create a new "entity" for role-playing "revision" of knowledge about the SCP universe.

[h3]ENTITY[/h3]

The main entity is the television, it has :
[list]
[*]  Audio announcer
[*]  Animated material
[*]  Multiple way to interact with it 
[*]  'AntiCheat'
[*]  Three different rewards
[*]  25 defaults questions & 4 response for each question
[*]  Configuration for add new questions or for configure values of the addon
[/list]

[/h2]Functionality[/h2]

When a player uses the 'Action' button on the entity, it lights up and the player is considered the candidate for the new show.
The presenter will announce the start of the game and ask the contestant a total of 3 questions, each of which is timed.

The questions are displayed on the candidate's screen, as well as to all players near the entity.
The contestant can answer them by writing the correct letter corresponding to one of the answers in the chat box.

If he answers correctly, he can continue answering the following questions ðŸ˜Ž
If he answers incorrectly, he will be burned alive ðŸ¥µ

By answering 3 questions correctly, the contestant will be rewarded with one of the 3 figurines available, and then the TV will switch itself off.

Of course, there are a few rules that the contestant must respect during the game, including :

[list]
[*]  Don't get too far away from the entity
[*]  Don't cheat ðŸ˜¡
[*]  Don't die
[*]  Answer within the time limit
[/list]

Failure to comply with any of the above rules will result in spontaneous combustion of the candidate (unless he's already dead, of course ðŸ’€).

[h3]REWARDS[/h3]

There are 3 awards as explained above, each is a small figurine,
Two correspond to an SCP (SCP-682 and SCP-173)
The last is just a little personal pleasure, interpret it as you want ðŸ™‚
